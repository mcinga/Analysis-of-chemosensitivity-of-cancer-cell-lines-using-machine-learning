USing machine learning to understand the link between gene expression, gene essentiality and the chemosensitivity of cancer cells.
Models are to be trained using Achilles and GDSC datasets. The idea is to alos learn the correlation between gene expressionand an drug sensitivity.
After training the model, feature importance will be performed, to identify those genes that are associated with variations in dose response.
The last step is to perform biological interpreeation. Wih the imporatnt genes identified the goal is to find which pathways associated with these genes as well find gene expresson changes after the cancer cell lines are treated with drugs.
